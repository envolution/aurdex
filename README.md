# auricle

**auricle** is a terminal user interface (TUI) for browsing AUR package metadata.

- Filter and search packages by name, maintainer, status, and more
- View detailed metadata, dependencies, and reverse dependencies
- Explore package git repositories and commit history

> **Note**: auricle is **not** an AUR helper. It does **not** install or build packages.  
> Itâ€™s designed for **viewing package information** and understanding dependency relationships.
